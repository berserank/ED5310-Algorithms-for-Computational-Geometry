# Polygon Triangulation
Assignment 1 of the course ED5310 at IIT Madras

Aim :  This assignment is on the implementation of the triangulation algorithm (preferably $O(n^2)$)

## [Polygon Generator]([https://www.google.com/](https://github.com/berserank/Polygon-Triangulation/blob/main/polygon_generator.py)https://github.com/berserank/Polygon-Triangulation/blob/main/polygon_generator.py).

This piece code was used to generate the polygon dataset. Using the function $polygon_generator(n)$ we can create a polygon (Convex or Non-Convex) of n vertices. The Ooutput of the said function is a list of n vertices in counter-clock wise order.
